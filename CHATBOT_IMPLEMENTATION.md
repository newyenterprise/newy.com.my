  process: ["Step 1", "Step 2"],
  pricing: "Pricing information",
  timeline: "Timeline information",
  technologies: ["Tech 1", "Tech 2"]
}
```

### Modifying AI Behavior
Edit the system prompt in the `getAIResponse` function to customize how Gemini AI responds to users.

### Styling
The chat interface uses Tailwind CSS classes and can be customized in `chat-assistant.tsx`.

## Performance Considerations

- **Response Time**: Gemini AI typically responds in 1-3 seconds
- **Context Management**: Efficient conversation state tracking
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks to custom system if Gemini fails
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal state management for optimal performance
- **Cost Optimization**: Token limits and efficient prompting

## Security & Privacy

- **API Key**: Securely stored and used only for AI responses
- **No Data Storage**: Conversation history is not permanently stored
- **Fallback System**: Custom system ensures functionality even if AI is unavailable

## Future Enhancements

1. **Multi-language Support**: Gemini AI can handle multiple languages
2. **Lead Qualification**: Automatically qualify leads based on conversation
3. **Appointment Booking**: Direct integration with calendar systems
4. **Analytics**: Track conversation patterns and user engagement
5. **File Upload**: Allow users to share project requirements or documents
6. **Voice Integration**: Add voice-to-text capabilities

## Testing

2. Clicking the chat button in the bottom-right corner
3. Asking questions about services, pricing, or contact information
4. Testing contextual responses by asking follow-up questions
5. Visiting `/api/chat/test-gemini` to verify Gemini AI integration
